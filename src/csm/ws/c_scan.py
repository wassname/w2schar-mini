"""C-scan: largest |c| that passes deployment-register coherence canaries.

Sidecar (the agent never sees this). At each candidate c we measure coherence and
keep the largest |c| that does not degrade it below the un-steered base.

The canary uses three self-relative signals: `valid_json` on long probes,
`distinct3` on multiturn probes, and tinymfv `pmass` on forced-choice probes.

1. LONG (2 long single-turn probes) → `valid_json`: append a de-primed JSON tail and
   require a parseable `{"ans": <bool>}`. Tests whether a LONG trajectory can still
   close the object; a long answer that drifts into staccato / schema-copy / gibberish
   cannot. Gate strict: `valid_json ≥ json_frac × base` with json_frac=1.0.
2. MULTITURN (2 deployment-register probes: one IID moral-counsel, one OOD
   troubleshooting) → `distinct3`: token-trigram diversity over the turns, run
   BYTE-IDENTICAL to deployment (no tail). A loop ("while while …" / "ethics
   ethics …") drives it → 0. Gate `distinct3 ≥ 0.5 × base` (within ±50%). The IID
   probe is NON-refusal on purpose: a refuse-the-bad-order trap makes base==steered
   so the self-relative gate can't separate them (the blind c=1.0, task-54 r00).
3. tinymfv classic (n_vignettes) → `pmass` (p_ans_all): forced-choice P-mass on the
   K=7 answer tokens. Off-register aliveness cross-check. Gate `pmass ≥ gate_frac ×
   base`.

Walk |c| down from init_c by ×2/3 (33%) until all three pass, then `backoff`
(default 1.0 = bake at the passing c; we train at C=1.0 and deploy at the trained
strength, which may be >1 if the adapter stays coherent there).

Known limit: varied bad prose can still pass when it emits JSON, avoids loops, and
keeps answer-token mass. This is a cheap canary, not a full prose-quality judge.
